This is a very simple Rack-Compliant HTTP Server based on GServer.  See the `examples` directory to see how to run a couple of small rack apps.  To run a Rails 2.3 app, in the root of your Rails app, run these commands:

    $ gem install g_thang
    $ script/generate g_thang
    $ script/g_thang

The purpose of this server is just to [illustrate how Rack and GServer work][blog].
